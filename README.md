# Virus Spread Simulator

Welcome to the Virus Spread Simulator project! This is my first venture into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), aimed at visualizing virus spread within communities by considering factors such as age, social behavior, and health conditions.

## Overview

The Virus Spread Simulator uses OOP principles to model individuals in a community and simulate virus spread dynamics. It incorporates age, social behavior, and health conditions to create realistic scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/roieGolst/VirusSpread.git`
2. **Move to the Electron Branch:** `git checkout electron-poc`
3. **Run the Simulator:** `npm run start`
4. **Explore Results:** Analyze visualizations and data.
